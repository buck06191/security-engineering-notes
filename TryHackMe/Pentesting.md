## Ethics

Pentesting needs to be done ethically and legally.

| White Hat        | These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.                    | For example, a penetration tester performing an authorised engagement on a company.          |
| Grey Hat         | These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times. | For example, someone taking down a scamming site.                                            |
| Black Hat        | These people  are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.      | For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom. |

**Rules of Engagement (ROE)**

The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections (explained in the table below), which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS institute has a great example of this document which you can view online [here](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/?).



|**Section**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Permission|This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.|
|Test Scope|This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.|
|Rules|The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.|

## Methodology

All pentesting engagements are different but there is a general theme of:


|**Stage** | **Description**|
|---|---|
|Information Gathering | This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.<br><br>**Note:** This does not involve scanning any systems.|
|Enumeration/Scanning|This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.|
|Exploitation|This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.|
|Privilege Escalation|Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).|
|Post-exploitation|This stage involves a few sub-stages:  <br><br>**1.** What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)<br><br>**2.** What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user<br><br>**3.**  Covering your tracks<br><br>**4.** Reporting|
### [OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf)

Detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:

1. **Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)**
2. Wired Networks
3. Wireless communications
4.

| Includes testing strategies for specific targets (I.e. telecommunications and networking)                                                                  |                                                                                               |
| The framework is flexible depending upon the organisation's needs.                                                                                         |                                                                                               |
| The framework is meant to set a standard for systems and applications, meaning that a universal methodology can be used in a penetration testing scenario. |                                                                                               |

### [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
Popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.

The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.  There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.

| **Advantages**                                                                                                             | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                  |

| The NIST Framework is estimated to be used by 50% of American organisations by 2020.                                       | NIST has many iterations of frameworks, so it may be difficult to decide which one applies to your organisation.   |
| The framework is extremely detailed in setting standards to help organisations mitigate the threat posed by cyber threats. | The NIST framework has weak auditing policies, making it difficult to determine how a breach occurred.             |
| The framework is very frequently updated.                                                                                  | The framework does not consider cloud computing, which is quickly becoming increasingly popular for organisations. |
| NIST provides accreditation for organisations that use this framework.                                                     |                                                                                                                    |

### NCSC CAF

The [Cyber Assessment Framework](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance) (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.

The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:

- Data security
- System security
- Identity and access control
- Resiliency
- Monitoring
- Response and recovery planning

| Advantages                                                                       | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| This framework is backed by a government cybersecurity agency.                   | The framework is still new in the industry, meaning that organisations haven't had much time to make the necessary changes to be suitable for it. |
| This framework provides accreditation.                                           | The framework is based on principles and ideas and isn't as direct as having rules like some other frameworks.                                    |
| This framework covers fourteen principles which range from security to response. |                                                                                                                                                   |

## Types of testing

### Black box testing
No knowledge of the system in advance. Tested acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application. Testing can involve interacting with the interface e.g. buttons, and tested to see whether the intended result is returned. Black-Box testing significantly increases the amount of time spent during the information gathering and enumeration phase to understand the attack surface of the target
### Grey Box Testing

This testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing. It is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes.The tester will have some **limited** knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.

With Grey-Box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

### White Box Testing 

This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time.

The tester will have **full** knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is much more time consuming than black-box testing. The full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire attack surface can be validated.
